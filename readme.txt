django_zendesk provides single-sign on functionality between a django.contrib.auth based site and Zendesk. Other authentication systems are compatible as long as they implement the @login_required decorator. 

SETUP:

django_zendesk needs two settings.py variables to be implemented:

ZENDESK_URL     = The URL of your support page, will either be on zendesk.com or your own domain (via a CNAME record)
ZENDESK_TOKEN   = The authentication token token you receive from Zendesk when setting up remote authentication

The only other code setup required is pointing a URL at the django_zendesk.views.authorize method, it will look something like:

(r'zendesk/$', 'django_zendesk.views.authorize')

Zendesk itself needs a bit of setup, including the URL we just set up above and a log-out URL which already should be implemented somewhere in your site.

Zendesk's documentation for remote authentication is here: http://www.zendesk.com/api/remote-authentication

If you're running the tests, make sure to set the TEST_DATABASE_CHARSET setting so that test databases are created to be utf8 compatible.
